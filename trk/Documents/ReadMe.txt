File Patterns
=============

Currently there are two tokens for file patterns. These are:

[REPOSITORYNAME]
This token gets replaced by the name of the repository selected in the UI.

[DATE:]
This uses the regular date formatting used in programming. These are case sensitive.

yyyy - This is the year in 4 digit format
MM - This is the month in a 2 digit numeric format.
dd - This is the day in a 2 digit numeric format.

The official list for user defined date formats from Microsoft is here:
